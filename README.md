# PartNumberScanner
Goods Delivery System, with QR tags comparison in pre-delivery process

## About The Project
This application was originally created to generate QR codes for Finish Goods products, scan it, and compare it to QR codes generated from customer's portal.
Currently this app supports the following functions:
1. Create New Product, generate QR code based on Product's Part Number on Save
2. Update created Product's properties
3. View List of created Products
4. Print Product's label (4 label for same product in A4 paper)
5. Create Delivery Planning
6. Update created Delivery Planning
7. View List of created Delivery Planning and it's status
8. Pre-delivery system, scan QR code on Product's label vs Customer's label, complete delivery if both QR codes match and meet specified quantity
